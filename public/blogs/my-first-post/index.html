During devcon i saw more and more real life use cases of crypto tech coming together like social goods and tech that bring people together. It might gave not make revenue or make money but in my opinion thats just what makes crypto interesting we get to meet people and hangout and learn from the great mind of the world. I didnt do much on Devcon mostly just networking and deciding what to build for ETH Global. I found that in devcon we also have a whitepaper session where people come together to read the whitepaper and learn about it. Thi allows people to read and exchange ideas on what they think about the paper." />

  <p>So i went to Devcon and ETH Global Bangkok at the same time since at the end of devcon the hackathon started on the end of the hackathon. So on that trip i had i learned alot about what is going on with the crypto space and what the market is going to be in terms of tech.</p>
<p>During devcon i saw more and more real life use cases of crypto tech coming together like social goods and tech that bring people together. It might gave not make revenue or make money but in my opinion thats just what makes crypto interesting we get to meet people and hangout and learn from the great mind of the world. I didnt do much on Devcon mostly just networking and deciding what to build for ETH Global. I found that in devcon we also have a whitepaper session where people come together to read the whitepaper and learn about it. Thi allows people to read and exchange ideas on what they think about the paper.</p>
<p>Moving on to ETH Bangkok which interest me the most where we start hacking. So me and my team we had an idea proposed by the guy himself 0xdelken where he works in Azuro protocol. So What he proposed was a pump fun prediction market. Pumpfun + prediction market where the fun of pumpfun meets prediction market. I met alot of people as well that i have never met and met about what their building. They are mostly building either ZK , AI Agent , Social App, wallets / payment, memecoins and some prediction market as well. Fast foward to the final day of the hackathon we finally finished the product and u guys can check it out as well called predpump.wtf its on testnet you guys can just mint the token and start playing.</p>
<p>Here are a few things that interest me during the hackathon and maybe it could inspire you on maybe on the things you guys could explore.</p>
<ol>
<li>ZK Apps with TEE
So this fascinates me because you could build ZK apps with executing those execution on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). This has always been on my bucket list but i never got a chance to tried it or build anything with it. But after this hackathon i saw someone building it so its a Zkubernetes. Pretty cool project was looking what it can do its mostly technical stuff but this is not consumer product where anyone even non tech could play with but its cool.</li>
<li>AI Agents
Alot of people i would say nearly 75% of people ive heard hacking there is hacking with some AI stuff to ease crypto apps. But AI Agents those change the game u could build it with Phala as well an TEE and people building stuff like AI Agents to help the buisness so its more like an automated thing. Not sure how specifically but while writing this im also looking around what interesting project i found. IndustryAI is also a cool project being build</li>
<li>DeSci
To be honest i was shocked someone already building this on the hackathon and won finalist which makes me feel this might be something as well on the crypto space. Reminds me of the event where Vitalik and CZ from Binance talking about DeSci. The project i saw was &ldquo;Cat In A Box is a DeSci and Social Fi platform empowering anyone to participate in community science and decentralized experiments. It incentivizes users to share private health data securely and engage in citizen science projects tailored to their interests.&rdquo; Tbh this is a good use case and i love how they design it as well.</li>
<li>Memecoins
People building apps that make use of memecoins so like this allows memcoins right now to have use cases maybe like app or anything that users can use the memecoins for. This is interesting since the memecoins space is the space where it onboard even the people who dont know crypto to knowing crypto. The best way to onboard user after they buy the memecoin is making an app for it so people can start playing and feel what its like to use crypto app. In a sense where it will make people learn how to use crypto apps and adding on top the wallets and payment app that allows people easily build wallets and all that. I think the industry is going to grow a lot in the upcoming years.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the things that catch my eyes on what we ca expect more things like this upcoming on the next 2025 hackathons and app being built. Thats all for this blogs guys till next time :33</p>
