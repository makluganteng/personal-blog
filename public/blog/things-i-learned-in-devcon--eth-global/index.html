Devcon Experience
During Devcon I saw more and more real life use cases of crypto tech coming together like social goods and tech that bring people together. It might have not make revenue or make money but in my opinion that&rsquo;s just what makes crypto interesting - we get to meet people and hangout and learn from the great mind of the world. I didn&rsquo;t do much on Devcon, mostly just networking and deciding what to build for ETH Global. I found that in Devcon we also have a whitepaper session where people come together to read the whitepaper and learn about it.

  <p>So I went to Devcon and ETH Global Bangkok at the same time since at the end of Devcon the hackathon started on the end of the hackathon. So on that trip I had I learned a lot about what is going on with the crypto space and what the market is going to be in terms of tech.</p>
<h2 id="devcon-experience">Devcon Experience</h2>
<p>During Devcon I saw more and more real life use cases of crypto tech coming together like social goods and tech that bring people together. It might have not make revenue or make money but in my opinion that&rsquo;s just what makes crypto interesting - we get to meet people and hangout and learn from the great mind of the world. I didn&rsquo;t do much on Devcon, mostly just networking and deciding what to build for ETH Global. I found that in Devcon we also have a whitepaper session where people come together to read the whitepaper and learn about it. This allows people to read and exchange ideas on what they think about the paper.</p>
<h2 id="eth-bangkok-hackathon">ETH Bangkok Hackathon</h2>
<p>Moving on to ETH Bangkok which interest me the most where we start hacking. So me and my team we had an idea proposed by the guy himself <strong>0xdelken</strong> where he works in <strong>Azuro protocol</strong>. So what he proposed was a pump fun prediction market - <em>PumpFun + prediction market</em> where the fun of PumpFun meets prediction market. I met a lot of people as well that I have never met and met about what they&rsquo;re building. They are mostly building either ZK, AI Agent, Social App, wallets/payment, memecoins and some prediction market as well. Fast forward to the final day of the hackathon we finally finished the product and you guys can check it out as well called <strong>predpump.wtf</strong> - it&rsquo;s on testnet you guys can just mint the token and start playing.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-trends-from-the-hackathon">Interesting Trends from the Hackathon</h2>
<p>Here are a few things that interest me during the hackathon and maybe it could inspire you on maybe on the things you guys could explore:</p>
<h3 id="1-zk-apps-with-tee">1. ZK Apps with TEE</h3>
<p>So this fascinates me because you could build ZK apps with executing those execution on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). This has always been on my bucket list but I never got a chance to tried it or build anything with it. But after this hackathon I saw someone building it so it&rsquo;s a <strong>Zkubernetes</strong>. Pretty cool project was looking what it can do - it&rsquo;s mostly technical stuff but this is not consumer product where anyone even non-tech could play with but it&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<h3 id="2-ai-agents">2. AI Agents</h3>
<p>A lot of people I would say nearly 75% of people I&rsquo;ve heard hacking there is hacking with some AI stuff to ease crypto apps. But AI Agents those change the game - you could build it with <strong>Phala</strong> as well an TEE and people building stuff like AI Agents to help the business so it&rsquo;s more like an automated thing. Not sure how specifically but while writing this I&rsquo;m also looking around what interesting project I found. <strong>IndustryAI</strong> is also a cool project being build.</p>
<h3 id="3-desci">3. DeSci</h3>
<p>To be honest I was shocked someone already building this on the hackathon and won finalist which makes me feel this might be something as well on the crypto space. Reminds me of the event where <strong>Vitalik</strong> and <strong>CZ</strong> from <strong>Binance</strong> talking about DeSci. The project I saw was &ldquo;<em>Cat In A Box</em> is a DeSci and Social Fi platform empowering anyone to participate in community science and decentralized experiments. It incentivizes users to share private health data securely and engage in citizen science projects tailored to their interests.&rdquo; Tbh this is a good use case and I love how they design it as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-memecoins">4. Memecoins</h3>
<p>People building apps that make use of memecoins so like this allows memcoins right now to have use cases maybe like app or anything that users can use the memecoins for. This is interesting since the memecoins space is the space where it onboard even the people who don&rsquo;t know crypto to knowing crypto. The best way to onboard user after they buy the memecoin is making an app for it so people can start playing and feel what it&rsquo;s like to use crypto app. In a sense where it will make people learn how to use crypto apps and adding on top the wallets and payment app that allows people easily build wallets and all that. I think the industry is going to grow a lot in the upcoming years.</p>
<hr>
<p>These are the things that catch my eyes on what we can expect more things like this upcoming on the next 2025 hackathons and app being built. That&rsquo;s all for this blogs guys till next time :33</p>
